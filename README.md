# smash-incremental-heap
Sometimes to understand things, we need to break them...

This breaks the [Incremental](https://github.com/janestreet/incremental) libary by "walking" nodes up the heap. This procedure is described [here](https://youtu.be/G6a5G5i4gQU?t=3020).
This is also my first ocaml code ever so just keep that in mind when reading over it.  

To run this code, you need [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) and [dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune). Then you need to install incremental `opam install incremental`.
